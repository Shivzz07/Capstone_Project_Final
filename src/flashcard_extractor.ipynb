      "Q: What is a major drawback of the classical waterfall model regarding feedback?  \n",
      "A: It has no feedback path, assuming no errors are committed during any phase, and does not incorporate error correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Why is it difficult to accommodate change requests in the classical waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: The model assumes all customer requirements can be completely defined at the beginning, but these requirements often change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is one advantage of the classical waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: It is easy to understand and considered the basis for other software development life cycle models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How are phases processed in the classical waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: Phases are processed one at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What does the classical waterfall model provide in terms of project milestones?  \n",
      "A: It has clear and well-understood milestones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What can result from a lengthy development cycle in the waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: It can lead to delays and increased costs if requirements change or new issues arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: When is the waterfall model best suited for use?  \n",
      "A: When there are well-understood requirements that are precise, reliable, and thoroughly documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is a key drawback of the iterative waterfall model regarding change requests?  \n",
      "A: All requirements must be clearly stated before starting development, limiting scope for changes after development begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is a limitation of incremental delivery in the iterative waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: The full software is completely developed and tested before delivery, not allowing for incremental delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does the iterative waterfall model differ from the classical waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: It allows for feedback paths from each phase to its preceding phases, enabling corrections of errors detected later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is a downside regarding stakeholder involvement in the waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: Stakeholders are typically involved only in the early phases and may not participate in later phases like implementation and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What issue arises from late defect detection in the waterfall model?  \n",
      "A: Defects may not be discovered until late in the development process, making them expensive and time-consuming to fix.\n"
